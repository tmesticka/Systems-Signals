Proposal
The created package aims to contain code that would based on user input, multiple data sources and a chosen statistical model help a freshly graduated high-school student chose the right university programme most suitable for them. The main idea is to gather data from websites that keep track of labour market and use multiple polls done in this environment to distinguish which profession, at the time of the individuals graduation, would be in need of employees on different positions or too crowded on the other hand. Worldwide. The vision is to somehow combine all the above mentioned into one python package that would be accessible to anyone who would be interested in such a thing. Although it sounds tough to combine user input (students interests), statistical models (predictions, regression analysis) and data from multiple reliable sources, I would like to take upon this challenge as much as maybe give it a nice visual site since I feel this is a concept that would have helped me pick my university path in the past. In conclusion this package aims to, given personal information specific for user, facts and a strong statistical model,  make the decision-making  as easy as possible. 

@khaakman @owenodriscoll do you believe this is a good project to get started with?
